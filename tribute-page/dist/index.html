      <h2>His Contributions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Algebra</strong> - a word derived from the title of a mathematical text he published in about 830 called “Al-Kitab al-mukhtasar fi hisab al-jabr wa’l-muqabala” (“The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing”). Al-Khwarizmi wanted to go from the specific problems considered by the Indians and Chinese to a more general way of analyzing problems, and in doing so he created an abstract mathematical language which is used across the world today.</li>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic</strong> - Al-Khwarizmi's work on arithmetic was responsible for introducing the Arabic numerals, based on the Hindu–Arabic numeral system developed in Indian mathematics, to the Western world. ... Both "algorithm" and "algorism" are derived from the Latinized forms of al-Khwārizmī's name, Algoritmi and Algorismi, respectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Astronomy</strong> - Al-Khwārizmī's Zīj al-Sindhind (Arabic: زيج السند هند‎, "astronomical tables of Siddhanta") is a work consisting of approximately 37 chapters on calendrical and astronomical calculations and 116 tables with calendrical, astronomical and astrological data, as well as a table of sine values. This is the first of many Arabic Zijes based on the Indian astronomical methods known as the sindhind. The work contains tables for the movements of the sun, the moon and the five planets known at the time. This work marked the turning point in Islamic astronomy. Hitherto, Muslim astronomers had adopted a primarily research approach to the field, translating works of others and learning already discovered knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>Geography</strong> - Al Khwarizmi applied a geometric model to solve quadratic equations, he called this application the square and rectangle method. He solved the equation of x2+10x=39 by using this method. where a, b, and c are positive integers. Thus, the total area of the square DGIE is (x+5)2, it is also equal to x2+10x+25.</li>
      </ul>
